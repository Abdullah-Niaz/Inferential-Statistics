# Inferential Statistics

## 1. What is Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical decision-making framework used to draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. Its purpose is to evaluate whether there is enough statistical evidence to support or reject a claim about a population parameter, such as a mean or proportion.

In simple terms, it helps answer questions like.
“Is this observed result due to random chance, or is it statistically significant?”

## 2. Components of Hypothesis Testing

### a. Null Hypothesis (H₀)

The null hypothesis represents the default or status-quo assumption. It states that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship.

Example.
H₀. The average height of students is 170 cm.

### b. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)

The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents the claim we want to test or prove.

Example.
H₁. The average height of students is not 170 cm.

## 3. Mechanism of Hypothesis Testing (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1. Formulate Hypotheses

Define the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis clearly.

### Step 2. Choose Significance Level (α)

The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
Common values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.

Example.
α = 0.05 means a 5% risk of making a wrong rejection.

### Step 3. Select the Appropriate Test

Choose a statistical test based on the data type, sample size, and population information.
Examples include Z-test, t-test, chi-square test.

### Step 4. Compute the Test Statistic

Calculate a numerical value that measures how far the sample result deviates from the null hypothesis.

### Step 5. Calculate the p-value

Determine the probability of observing the test result, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

### Step 6. Make a Decision

Compare the p-value with the significance level.

* If p-value ≤ α, reject H₀
* If p-value > α, fail to reject H₀

### Step 7. Draw a Conclusion

Interpret the result in the context of the original problem.

## 4. What is a p-value

The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

Important interpretation.

* A small p-value indicates strong evidence against H₀
* A large p-value indicates weak evidence against H₀

Example.
If p-value = 0.03 and α = 0.05, the result is statistically significant, and H₀ is rejected.

Key clarification.
The p-value does not tell you the probability that the null hypothesis is true. It only measures evidence against it.

## 5. What is a Z-test

A Z-test is a parametric statistical test used to determine whether the mean of a sample differs significantly from a known population mean, or whether two population means differ, when certain conditions are met.

---

## 6. Conditions for Using a Z-test

A Z-test is appropriate when.

* The population standard deviation (σ) is known
* The sample size is large (n ≥ 30), or the population is normally distributed
* The data is continuous and randomly sampled

---

## 7. Z-test Formula

For a single-sample Z-test.

[
Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
]

Where.

* (\bar{x}) = sample mean
* (\mu) = population mean
* (\sigma) = population standard deviation
* (n) = sample size

---

## 8. Decision Rule in Z-test

You can make a decision using either method.

### a. Critical Value Method

Compare the calculated Z-value with the critical Z-value from the Z-table.

### b. p-value Method

Compare the p-value with α.

If the calculated Z falls in the rejection region, or if p-value ≤ α, reject H₀.

---

## 9. Practical Example (Brief)

Suppose.

* Population mean = 50
* Sample mean = 53
* Population standard deviation = 10
* Sample size = 36

[
Z = \frac{53 - 50}{10 / \sqrt{36}} = \frac{3}{1.67} \approx 1.80
]

At α = 0.05, the critical Z-value is ±1.96.
Since 1.80 < 1.96, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

---

## 10. Summary

* Hypothesis testing is a formal method to make data-driven decisions
* The p-value quantifies evidence against the null hypothesis
* The Z-test is used when population variance is known and sample size is sufficiently large
* Statistical significance does not automatically imply practical importance
